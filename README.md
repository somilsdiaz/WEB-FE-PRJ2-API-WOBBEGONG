# WEB-FE-PRJ2-API-WOBBEGONG

This repository hosts a Mock API built with [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for a project utilizing React, Vite, and Tailwind. Deployed on Render, the API supplies simulated data to support the projectâ€™s frontend application, which relies on [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) to manage data fetching in React.

## Deployment

- **API on Render**: [https://web-fe-prj2-api-wobbegong-qfq7.onrender.com/](https://web-fe-prj2-api-wobbegong-qfq7.onrender.com/)
- **Associated Frontend**: [https://web-fe-html-css-prj2-wobbegong-he44.onrender.com](https://web-fe-html-css-prj2-wobbegong-he44.onrender.com)

## API Overview

The Mock API delivers multiple categorized datasets for use in the frontend, such as product categories, filtering options, product details (PDP), promotional content, and more. These datasets are systematically organized into modules and exposed as JSON objects, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend components.

## Project Dependencies

- **json-server**: Utilized to emulate a comprehensive REST API based on the structured mock data provided.

For development, this setup ensures an efficient and responsive environment for frontend testing, mirroring real-world API interactions.
